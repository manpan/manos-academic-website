I am a Professor of Cyber Security and Deputy Head of the Centre for Sustainable Cyber Security (CS2) at the University of Greenwich, London, UK. My research revolves around modeling, assessing and mitigating cybersecurity and privacy risks. I'm currently researching methods of assessing cyber and privacy risks posed by AI.
