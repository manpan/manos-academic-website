title: "SUN - Social and hUman ceNtered XR"
abstract: "Extended reality (XR) is an emerging technology with promising potential in many fields including health, communication and safety. However, overcoming XRâ€™s limitations in providing authentic interactive social environments is key to further developing its applications. The EU-funded SUN project aims to advance the social interactivity of XR technology by establishing scalable models with sustained and convincing virtual environments. The project will also improve the data-processing capability of wearable devices and develop wearable sensors and tactile interfaces to improve user experience. SUN will validate these models in three real-life situations: rehabilitation therapy, improved safety and social interaction among workers, and facilitate interaction for disabled users."
