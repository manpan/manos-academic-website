title: "MERIT - A fraMEwoRk to Model and IncenTivise Cyber Security Investment Decisions"
abstract: "MERIT is addressing the complete cyber security management lifecycle, including asset pricing, threat-based risk assessment and optimal risk control constrained by a financial budget. The value of MERIT to practitioners is to **increase the effectiveness of cyber security budget spending** as decided by Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and boards of directors. This effectiveness refers to both time to make a decision as well as financial savings."
