The Centre for Sustainable Cyber Security (CS2) with an annual research expenditure exceeding £1M, comprises a team of 44 faculty members, postdocs, and PhD researchers. CS2 collaborates with industry, public sector, and academic partners to conduct cutting-edge research 

Research of our members covers a range of topics with the core challenges being:
* Challenge 1: Secure Cyber-Physical Systems 
* Challenge 2: Trustworthy AI
* Challenge 3: Improving Efficiency of Digital Forensics
* Challenge 4: Certified Sustainable Security and Privacy
