title: "TT-SVD: An efficient sparse decision making model with two-way trust recommendation in the AI enabled IoT systems"
abstract: "The convergence of AI and IoT enables data to be quickly explored and turned into vital decisions, and however, there are still some challenging issues to be further addressed. For example, lacking of enough data in AI-based decision making (so-called Sparse Decision Making, SDM) will decrease the efficiency dramatically, or even disable the intelligent IoT networks. Taking the intelligent IoT networks as the network infrastructure, the recommendation systems have been facing such SDM problems. A naive solution is to introduce trust information. However, trust information may also face the difficulty of sparse trust evidence (a.k.a sparse trust problem). In our work, an accurate sparse decision-making model with two-way trust recommendation in the AI-enabled IoT systems is proposed, named TT-SVD. Our model incorporates both trust information and rating information more thoroughly, which can efficiently alleviate the above-mentioned sparse trust problem and therefore be able to solve the cold start and data sparsity problems. Specifically, we first consider the two-fold trust influences from both trustees and trusters, which can be represented by a factor named trust propensity. To this end, We propose a dual model, including a truster model (TrusterSVD) and a trustee model (TrusteeSVD) based on an existing rating-only recommendation model called SVD++, which are integrated by the weighted average and yield the final model, TT-SVD. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art including SVD and TrustSVD in both the \"all users\" and \"cold start users\" cases, and the accuracy improvement can reach a maximum of 29%. Complexity analysis shows that our model is equally suitable for the case of large sparse datasets. In a summary, our model can effectively solve the sparse decision problem by introducing the two-way trust recommendation, and hence improve the efficiency of the intelligent recommendation systems."
