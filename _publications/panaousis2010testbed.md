title: "A testbed implementation for securing olsr in mobile ad hoc networks"
abstract: "Contemporary personal computing devices are increasingly required to be portable and mobile
enabling user’s wireless access, to wired network infrastructures and services. This approach to
mobile computing and communication is only appropriate in situations where a coherent
infrastructure is available. There are many situations where these requirements are not fulfilled
such as; developing nations, rural areas, natural disasters, and military conflicts to name but a few.
A practical solution is to use mobile devices interconnected via a wireless medium to form a
network, known as a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET), and provide the services normally found in
wired networks. Security in MANETs is an issue of paramount importance due to the wireless nature
of the communication links. Additionally due to the lack of central administration security issues are
different from conventional networks. For the purposes of this article we have used the WMN testbed 
to enable secure routing in MANETs.The use of cryptography is an efficient proven way of securing data in communications, but some cryptographic algorithms are not as efficient as others and require more processing power, which is detrimental to MANETs. In this article we have assessed different cryptographic approaches to securing the OLSR (Optimised Link State Routing)
protocol to provide a basis for research. We conclude the paper with a series of performance
evaluation results regarding different cryptographic and hashing schemes. Our findings clearly
show that the most efficient combination of algorithms used for authentication and encryption are
SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm-1) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) respectively. Using
this combination over their counterparts will lead to a considerable reduction in processing time
and delay on the network, creating an efficient transaction moving towards satisfying resource
constraints and security requirements."
